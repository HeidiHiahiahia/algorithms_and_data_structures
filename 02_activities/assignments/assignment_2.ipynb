The function appends the current node's value to the path list and recursively invokes itself for the left and right children. Once a leaf node is encountered, the current path list is added to the paths list. Finally, the function returns the complete paths list."

Testing the function with various binary tree structures was crucial in verifying its correctness and robustness. I went through trial and errors. The assignment itself turned out to be more challenging than I assumed from the beginning. As there are many unexpected errors came up, which really improved my problem solving skills and understood better how to code more efficiently.\n",
